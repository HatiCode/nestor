# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Catalog Service MVP serves as the foundation layer of the Nestor platform, providing a centralized repository of infrastructure resource definitions. This service acts as a "buffet" where developers can discover and consume low-level infrastructure components (databases, storage, compute, networking, etc.) that platform teams have defined and validated.

The MVP focuses on core functionality: storing, retrieving, and serving component definitions through a REST API, with DynamoDB as the initial storage backend. The architecture emphasizes SOLID principles and dependency injection to ensure the system can evolve and support additional storage backends, validation engines, and integration patterns as the platform grows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Storage and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve infrastructure component definitions from the catalog, so that I can understand what resources are available and how to use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests a component by name THEN the system SHALL return the latest version of that component definition
2. WHEN a client requests a component by name and version THEN the system SHALL return the specific version requested
3. WHEN a requested component does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate error details
4. WHEN a requested component version does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with version-specific error details
5. IF a component exists but is deprecated THEN the system SHALL return the component with deprecation metadata included

### Requirement 2: Component Listing and Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to browse available infrastructure components by category and provider, so that I can discover resources that meet my application needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests all components THEN the system SHALL return a paginated list of all active components
2. WHEN a client filters by provider THEN the system SHALL return only components matching that provider
3. WHEN a client filters by category THEN the system SHALL return only components matching that category
4. WHEN a client filters by multiple criteria THEN the system SHALL return components matching all specified filters
5. WHEN pagination parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return results according to the specified page size and offset
6. IF no components match the filter criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty list with appropriate metadata

### Requirement 3: Component Version Management

**User Story:** As a platform team member, I want to manage multiple versions of component definitions, so that I can evolve resources while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests version history for a component THEN the system SHALL return all versions in descending chronological order
2. WHEN a client requests the latest version of a component THEN the system SHALL return the most recent non-deprecated version
3. WHEN semantic version constraints are applied THEN the system SHALL return versions that satisfy the constraint
4. IF a component has only deprecated versions THEN the system SHALL return the most recent deprecated version with appropriate warnings
5. WHEN version metadata is requested THEN the system SHALL include creation date, git commit, and deprecation status

### Requirement 4: Health and Observability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to monitor the catalog service health and performance, so that I can ensure reliable service for development teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return service status and dependency health
2. WHEN the readiness endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL verify storage connectivity and return appropriate status
3. WHEN storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return unhealthy status with error details
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log structured request/response information with correlation IDs
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 5: Storage Abstraction and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want the catalog service to use pluggable storage backends, so that we can adapt to different infrastructure requirements and scale the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL initialize the configured storage backend through a factory pattern
2. WHEN storage operations are performed THEN they SHALL use database-agnostic interfaces
3. WHEN a new storage backend is added THEN it SHALL implement the same interface without changing business logic
4. WHEN storage configuration changes THEN the service SHALL support different backends (DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) through configuration
5. IF storage initialization fails THEN the service SHALL fail to start with clear error messaging

### Requirement 6: Component Validation and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a platform team member, I want component definitions to be validated before storage, so that only well-formed and complete resources are available to developers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is stored THEN the system SHALL validate required metadata fields (name, version, provider, category)
2. WHEN semantic version format is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the component with validation errors
3. WHEN required input/output specifications are missing THEN the system SHALL reject the component
4. WHEN deployment engine specifications are incomplete THEN the system SHALL reject the component
5. IF validation passes THEN the system SHALL store the component and return success confirmation

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and API Consistency

**User Story:** As a client developer, I want consistent and informative error responses from the catalog API, so that I can handle failures appropriately in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 400 status with detailed field-level error information
2. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 status with resource identification details
3. WHEN storage errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 status with correlation ID for tracking
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry information
5. WHEN all errors occur THEN the response SHALL include consistent error structure with code, message, and trace ID

### Requirement 8: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to configure the catalog service for different environments, so that I can deploy it consistently across development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables and config files
2. WHEN storage configuration is provided THEN it SHALL support DynamoDB connection parameters (region, table name, credentials)
3. WHEN logging configuration is specified THEN it SHALL support different log levels and output formats
4. WHEN server configuration is set THEN it SHALL support port, timeout, and middleware settings
5. IF required configuration is missing THEN the service SHALL fail to start with clear error messages indicating missing values
